### Using FoneMonkey libraries to automate a sample android app (in this case a fonemonkey app)
*** 
### Updated:Dec 8, 2011 
### Status: Work Completed and Working
### Issues: Currently having some issues with adb that should not be a problem
***
#### Useful Command to install the app manually, in your terminal Android SDK path i.e. ~/android-sdk/platform-tools/$ run: 
     ./adb install ~/FoneMonkeyAndroid/workspace/fonemonkey_testapp/bin/fonemonkey_testapp.apk
***
### Getting Started
#### Register @  Gorilla and download FoneMonkey and follow the instructions
     http://www.gorillalogic.com/fonemonkey4android.
***
#### You'll need at least  Eclipse 3.7 and the FoneMonkey console which comes with the downloadable zip file
#### Note: Make sure you setup the fonemonkey_testapp project and run it in the emulator and then launch the console.
